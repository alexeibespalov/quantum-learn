# Cursor Rules for QuantumLearn

## Documentation References

When strategizing architecture, planning features, or making design decisions, **ALWAYS** consult and consider the following documentation files:

1. **instructions.md** - Contains the complete MVP technical design document with detailed specifications for all pages, features, and user flows. This is the authoritative source for feature requirements, UI/UX specifications, and MVP scope.

2. **research.md** - Contains evidence-based learning science research, curriculum requirements, AI tutoring architecture, and pedagogical foundations. Reference this when implementing learning algorithms, adaptive systems, or educational features.

3. **CLAUDE.md** - Contains project overview, tech stack, architecture notes, and development guidelines. Use this for understanding the technical foundation and project structure.

## Guidelines

- Before designing or implementing any feature, review the relevant sections in these files
- When making architectural decisions, ensure alignment with the principles and patterns described in these documents
- If there are conflicts or ambiguities, prioritize instructions.md for feature specifications, research.md for pedagogical/learning science decisions, and CLAUDE.md for technical implementation details
- These files should be treated as the source of truth for project requirements and design decisions
